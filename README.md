# terraform-project

This is a test repo for learning Terraform with New Relic using the instructions found
at [developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/get-started-terraform)

Also the [repo example found here was helpful](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-azure).

[Free Code Camp's training module on Terraform](https://youtu.be/SLB_c_ayRMo) was also used in this project.
